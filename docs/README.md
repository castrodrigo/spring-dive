# Spring Dive

After shifting to other languages throught my carreer I've had less contact with Java and updates that I would like to.
This project is an attempt to recollect some of the magic and enjoy the benefits of Spring/SpringBoot, catch up with some of the updates, notations and perks of the framework itself to build an reliable microservice in future projects.

## Techonologies

- Spring 5+ / SpringBoot 2+
- Java 11
- H2 Database
- Thymeleaf (I miss React but not the focus here :)

## Installing packages

```
mvn verify
```

## Running application
